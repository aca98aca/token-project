# Tokenomics Simulation Project - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

This project simulates a tokenomics ecosystem with various components:
- Agents (miners, traders, holders, stakers)
- Market mechanisms (price discovery, market maker)
- Consensus protocols (PoW, PoS, DPoS)
- Governance systems

## Current Implementation Status

The core components have been implemented, and we are now working on integration testing to ensure all parts work together properly. We are also upgrading the market mechanisms and agent strategies using proven libraries.

## Implementation Tasks

### Immediate Tasks (Fix Test Issues)

1. **Standardize Agent Interface** (Priority: High) ✅

   - Add is_operational() method to all agent classes ✅

2. **Enhance Consensus Module** (Priority: High) ✅
   - Add is_healthy() method to ProofOfWork ✅
   - Add current_height as an alias for current_block ✅

   - Add performance metrics

3. **MarketMaker** (`token_sim/market/market_maker.py`)
   - Integrate hummingbot strategies
   - Implement liquidity pool simulation
   - Add market maker performance metrics
   - Create automated market making logic

4. **ProofOfWork** (`token_sim/consensus/pow.py`)
   - Add is_healthy() method
   - Add current_height alias for current_block
   - Add total_storage attribute

## Code Patterns To Standardize

1. **Agent State Access**
   ```python
   # Use
   agent.state['token_balance']
   
   # Instead of
   agent.token_balance
   ```

2. **Module Status Checking**
   ```python
   def is_healthy(self):
       # Check critical conditions
       return all([cond1, cond2, cond3])
   ```

3. **Parameter Access in Tests**
   ```python
   # Use
   simulation_model.params['simulation_months']
   
   # Instead of
   simulation_model.params.simulation_months
   ```

4. **Market Analysis**
   ```python
   # Use ta-lib for technical analysis
   import talib
   rsi = talib.RSI(close_prices)
   macd = talib.MACD(close_prices)
   ```

5. **Trading Strategy**
   ```python
   # Use FinRL for trading strategies
   from finrl.agents.stablebaselines3.models import DRLAgent
   agent = DRLAgent(env=TokenEnvironment)
   ```

6. **Market Making**
   ```python
   # Use hummingbot for market making
   from hummingbot.strategy.pure_market_making import PureMarketMakingStrategy
   strategy = PureMarketMakingStrategy()
   ```
