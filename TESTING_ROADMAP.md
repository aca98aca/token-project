# Tokenomics Simulation Project Testing Roadmap

## Current Status

We have implemented integration tests for the tokenomics simulation project in `tests/test_integration.py`. The tests verify the correct integration of various components including agents (miners, holders, traders), market mechanisms, consensus protocols, and governance systems.

Currently, 13 tests are passing, 2 are marked as expected failures (xfail), and 2 are skipped (AI-related tests).

## Completed Work
- ✅ Set up basic test structure
- ✅ Implemented test fixtures
- ✅ Added simulation initialization tests
- ✅ Added performance and scalability tests
- ✅ Fixed agent-related issues
- ✅ Fixed governance module issues
- ✅ Fixed market issues
- ✅ Updated test parameters to match implementation

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Consensus Module Issues
- ⚠️ Consensus recovery not fully implemented (test marked as xfail)
  - Need more robust recovery implementation in ProofOfWork

### 2. Reproducibility Issues
- ⚠️ Price simulation not fully reproducible between runs (test marked as xfail)
  - Need more deterministic price simulation implementation

### 3. AI-Related Tests
- ⚠️ AI agent tests are skipped
  - Need to implement AI agent features

## Future Test Extensions

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Add specific unit tests for each component
   - Test edge cases and error handling

2. **Fuzz Testing**
   - Implement fuzz testing for market behavior under extreme conditions
   - Test with random agent behaviors

3. **Benchmarks**
   - Add comprehensive benchmark suite
   - Test performance with large agent populations
   - Compare different consensus mechanisms

4. **AI Agent Tests**
   - Implement tests for AI agent learning
   - Test agent adaptation to different market conditions

## Running Tests

Tests can be run with:
```
python -m pytest tests/test_integration.py -v
```

To run specific tests:
```
python -m pytest tests/test_integration.py::TestSimulationIntegration::test_name -v
```
